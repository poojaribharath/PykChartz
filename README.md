# PykCharts

PykCharts.js is an open-source Javascript library of reusable charts similar to [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/) and [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/). PykCharts.js was built with the single aim of making it trivial for developers to use [d3.js](http://www.highcharts.com/) charts in their projects. Hence, developers with minimum knowledge of d3 can write a single line interface in their HTML to render complex d3 charts. 

The long term vision of PykCharts is to build / evolve a framework on top of d3 for developing clean, structured and reusable charts.
