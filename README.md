# PykCharts

PykCharts.js is an open-source Javascript library of reusable charts similar to NVD3 and HighCharts. PykCharts.js was built with the single aim of making it trivial for developers to use d3.js charts in their projects. Hence, developers with minimum knowledge of d3 can write a single line interface in their HTML to render complex d3 charts. The long term vision of PykCharts is to build / evolve a framework on top of d3 for developing clean, structured and reusable charts.
